            <p class="main-desc">GoCD operates on a server-agent model where a server communicates with many agents. Agents are the workers in GoCD ecosystem. Rather than having dedicated idle agents at all times, elastic agents allow you to scale up, with on-demand agents, based on the need of the task being executed. This saves you both time and costs.</p>

          <p>A guiding principle for GoCD is to keep it as agnostic as possible. We'd like, you, the user to choose what technology you want to use and provision agents there. Therefore, we put a lot of time and effort into our API, so you can just plug in any cloud provider you have or build your own plugin. </p>
          <p>We have a whole bunch of plugins for you to use Elastic Agents. If you're running builds on OpenStack, Docker or Docker Swarm, we've got you covered.</p>
